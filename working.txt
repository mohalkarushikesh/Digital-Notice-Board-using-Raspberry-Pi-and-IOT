Edit your web server configuration file:

For Nginx, the main configuration file is usually located at /etc/nginx/nginx.conf. For Apache, the main configuration file is usually located at /etc/apache2/apache2.conf. Use your preferred text editor to open the configuration file.

Add a new server block for HTTPS traffic:

For Nginx, add the following code to your configuration file:

bash
Copy code
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name example.com;
    ssl_certificate /path/to/certificate.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/private.key;
    # any other SSL-related settings
    # ...
    # any other server settings
    # ...
}
Replace example.com with your domain name and /path/to/certificate.crt and /path/to/private.key with the paths to your SSL/TLS certificate and private key, respectively.
